                    <br>
                    <p>The definition of a miracle is a surprising and welcome event that is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore considered to be the work of a divine agency.  In various religions, a phenomenon that is characterized as miraculous is often attributed to the actions of a supernatural being. Historically, the appeal to miracles has formed one of the primary lines of argument in favor of specific forms of theism, the argument typically being that the event in question can best be explained as the act of a particular deity.

                    <h3>Christianity and Miracles</h3>
                <p>The concept of a miracle undoubtedly has religious connotations associated with it. The Gospel is full of accounts of miraculous events recorded by the apostles of Jesus. 
                    Jesus explains in the New Testament that miracles are performed by faith in God. "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'move from here to there' and it will move." (Gospel of Matthew 17:20).
                
                <br> <p>The Christian Church believes miracles are works of God, either directly, or through the prayers and intercessions of a specific saint or saints. There is usually a specific purpose connected to a miracle. For example, the conversion of a person or persons to the Catholic faith or the construction of a church desired by God.</p>

                <h2 id="examples">Five Most Important Miracles of Jesus:</h2>
                <p id="one"><p>Feeding the 5,000: <br> <br>
                    "Then He said, “Bring them here to me,” and He ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds. They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments left over—twelve wicker baskets. Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and children." Matthew 14:18-21
               <br><br> The feeding of the multitude teaches us that God is faithful in providing for His children. We must look beyond our earthly resources and limitations. Trust that He can meet our every need. Jesus not only gave his people physical nourishment, he fed their souls and spirit.
                </p>
                <p id="two"><p>Calming the Storm: <br> <br>
                    "He got into a boat and his disciples followed him. Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by waves; but He was asleep. They came and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” He said to them, “Why are you terrified, O you of little faith?” Then He got up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was great calm. The men were amazed and said, “What sort of man is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey?” Matthew 8:23-27
                <br><br> The miracle of Jesus calming the storm at sea reminds us to grow faith in God. As long as we believe in the power of God and His unwavering love for us, we can weather any storm and overcome upheavals that come our way.</p>
                
                <p id="three"><p>Rising of Lazarus: <br> <br>
                    "So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay across it. Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to Him, “Lord, by now there will be a stench; he has been dead for four days.” Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?” So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you for hearing me. I know that you always hear me; but because of the crowd here I have said this, that they may believe that you sent me.” And when He had said this, He cried out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” The dead man came out, tied hand and foot with burial bands, and his face was wrapped in a cloth. So Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.” John 11:38-44
                <br><br>The story of Lazarus being resurrected reminds us that God has power over death and darkness. This miracle lets us see that death is not the end and that there is more to life than pain and suffering but true life can only come from God. We must surrender our lives to our Lord and have faith that He will give us eternal life.</p>
            <br>
                <p id="four">The Last Supper: <br> <br>
                    "Then He took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me.” And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you." Luke 22:19-20 <br>
                    <br>In the story of the Last Supper, Jesus ate His last meal with His apostles. During this time He performed what could be the greatest miracle in the Catholic Faith: He transformed bread and wine into His body and blood. This miracle is commemorated in every mass through the celebration of the Holy Eucharist. In the Last Supper, the bread signifies Jesus’ body being the bread of life. Accepting Jesus’ body is like accepting Him in our daily lives and that we must live the way Jesus wanted us to live. The wine signifies the blood of Christ, that was willingly given to man’s salvation. <br>
                <br>
                <p id="five">Jesus' Resurrection: <br> <br>
                    "But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been. And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken my Lord, and I don’t know where they laid Him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She thought it was the gardener and said to Him, “Sir, if you carried Him away, tell me where you laid Him, and I will take Him.”Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni,” which means teacher. Jesus said to her, “Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and what He told her. John 20:11-18
                <br> <br> The miracle of Jesus’ resurrection is magnificent in many ways. First it reveals that Jesus is truly both God and man. He is so powerful he overcame even death. Second, it fulfills God’s promised gift of salvation. Through His son, Jesus Christ, He saved us all from sin.</p>

                <h2 id="contact">Arguments</h2>
                <p>Many participants in the discussion have been ready to grant that the miracle must have been worked by God and that it provides significant confirmation for the doctrine or claim.</p>
                <h3>Would miracles be evidence for the existence of God?</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two exceptions to this general acquiescence in the evidential value of miracles. First, there is a question regarding the identity of the cause. If God alone can work miracles, this is easily settled; but this claim has been a point of contention in the theological literature.
                    Second, it is occasionally argued that, contrary to what most philosophers and theologians have assumed, actual confirmed cases of miracles could not count in favor of the existence of God. 
                    "George Chryssides (1975) argues that a miracle, conceived as a violation of a scientific law, could never be attributed to any agent, divine or otherwise, since the assignment of agency implies predictability."
                </p>
                <h3>How much would credible miracle reports establish?</h3>
            <p>To say this is not to endorse a lazy and unprincipled relativism; rather, the point is that one’s considered rational judgment regarding the existence and nature of God must take into account far more than the evidence for miracle claims. That is not to say that they could not be an important or even, under certain circumstances, a decisive piece of evidence; it is simply that neither a positive nor a negative claim regarding the existence of God can be established on the basis of evidence for a miracle claim alone, without any consideration of other aspects of the question.</p>
